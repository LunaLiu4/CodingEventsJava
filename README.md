1.Our Person class might hold the following fields:

id (int) - the unique user ID
firstName (String) - the user’s first name
lastName (String) - the user’s last name
email (String) - the user’s email, which will also function as their username
password (String) - the user’s password
The class would need getters for all of these fields. It could have setters for all fields except id (since it shouldn’t change).

2.The Person class might also have the following references:

PersonProfile - a class to gather up all of the profile information about the user
List<Events> eventsAttending - to store events the user wants to attend
List<Events> eventsOwned - a different list, to store the events the user has created

3.Person would have a many-to-many relationship with Event via List<Events> eventsAttending. It would have a one-to-many relationship with Event via List<Events> eventsOwned.
